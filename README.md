# How to Run Project

This project tests the Jasmine suite. It can pull in many different feeds from many different websites. In order to run this code open the index.html file in any browser. You should see the web page load and then below it should be jasmine telling you all the test cases that were either passed or failed. If you wish to edit the code then please make sure that all these tests pass once you are finished.
